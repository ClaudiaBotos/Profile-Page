               <h1> Why me?</h1>
          <p> Well , it is true that I am a junior, but it is also true that we,juniors, are the future. I can rise up to my clients standards by working hard and never stop learning.</p>
              <p> I am looking to improve all my skills by working harder and harder and prove myself to the world. The first step I took was signing up for Treehouse and starting to learn. Slowly I began to understand and to code. Coding is slowly becoming like an addiction, you want to know more, to do more. It is true than I am not very experienced yet, but this is about to change , as I will do my best.</p>
          
         
          
         
          <h3> What I plan to do to achieve my purpose?</h3>
              <p> I will not stop here and I will try to learn more, HTML and CSS are just the beginning. After I am done knowing all I need , I plan to learn Java Script and all the others lessons I need to become a front-end developer. </p>
